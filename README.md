### Organize your workflow and all related data into context layers

Switch your focus from **RandomProjectA/Customers/Foo/ComlianceReports** to **RandomProjectB/Infra/JIRA-NNN** and dynamically update your browser tabs(plugin ff and chrome derivates), notes, todos, display related files(webdav-mapped dynamical folder is the only cross-platform sollution for now), emails(you can assign contacts or specific subject strings to a context layer/canvas), events, contacts and a lot more. 

Easy to integrate with other tools to "contextualize" even non-context aware apps (bash / bash_history, dynamic profile/XDG paths etc)
